Artifacts for the foundational paper on CMPRs "Scalable Nonlinear Sequence Generation using Composite Mersenne Product Registers", published in the IACR CiC journal. The library dependencies are `memoization numba numpy galois python-sat`.

In this repository, we include the version of the Product Registers Library used to conduct experiments for the stream ciphers above journal paper, along with the source code used in our experiments.
